# Breast Cancer Detection

Using statistical analysis, we examine ways in which malignant and benign tumors differ in their characteristics. It was vital to determine if an informative lower dimensional structure of the variables exists, and use that structure to train classification models to predict whether a mass is benign or malignant. An important outcome was our classification model which yielded 95% accuracy, but also provided valuable insights into the relative costs of false positives versus false negatives.

Statistical Methods: 
- Hotellingâ€™s T2 Two Sample Test
- Principal Components Analysis (PCA)
- Classification
