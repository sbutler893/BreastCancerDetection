The purpose of this statistical analysis is to examine the ways in which malignant and benign tumors differ in their characteristics. The secondary purpose is to determine if an informative lower dimensional structure of the variables exists, and use that structure to train classification models to predict whether a mass is benign or malignant. The goal is to select the classification model that yields the highest accuracy, but also to discuss the relative costs of False Positives versus False Negatives.
